## 📧 Email System Configuration

- ✅ **Domain Verified**: `greybrain.ai` is verified with Resend
- ✅ **Sender Address**: `welcome@greybrain.ai`
- ✅ **Welcome Emails**: Automatically sent when users are added
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Handled properly to avoid issues

## 🚀 How Your Team Can Access the Application

### For All Whitelisted Users:
1. **Visit your Netlify URL** (your deployed application)
2. **Click "Sign in with Email"**
3. **Enter their whitelisted email address**
4. **Check their email** for the magic link
5. **Click the magic link** to gain immediate access
6. **Receive welcome email** with instructions

### Authentication Logic:
The application checks **BOTH**:
- Hardcoded whitelist in `config/whitelistedEmails.ts`
- Supabase `whitelisted_users` table (added via admin dashboard)

Users can authenticate if they appear in **either** location.
