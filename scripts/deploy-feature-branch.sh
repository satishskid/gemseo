# Architectural Improvements - Staging Deployment

**Deployment Date:** $(date)
**Feature Branch:** $FEATURE_BRANCH
**Environment:** Staging
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Deployed Features
- 🔒 **API Key Security**: Encrypted storage with fallback
- 🛡️ **Error Boundaries**: Enhanced error handling with recovery
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Client/server validation with sanitization
- ⚡ **Loading States**: Improved user feedback during operations
- 📱 **Offline Support**: Service worker with background sync
- ♿ **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Testing Status
- ✅ Security tests passed
- ✅ Performance tests passed (with warnings)
- ✅ Accessibility tests passed (with warnings)
- ✅ Integration tests passed
- ✅ Post-deployment smoke tests completed

## Next Steps
1. Test the staging deployment thoroughly
2. Run user acceptance testing
3. Review performance metrics
4. If all tests pass, merge to main branch

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
1. Disable feature flags via environment variables
2. Revert to previous stable deployment
3. Investigate and fix issues
